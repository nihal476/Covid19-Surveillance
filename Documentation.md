The documentation is written to let people know about our project and to inform them that we are new to open-source projects so it's not as comprehensive as it could be.
We will provide instructions on how to use the Covid-19 Tracking System, which is used by both patients and doctors. 
It would identify those who were impacted.
It is generally integrated with hospital administration software to give accessible visualizations illustrating various parts of the covid pandemic. 
Furthermore, we plan to avoid some of what we did in this documentation, even if it is incomplete, 
but it will provide a summary of what we did as well as a suggestion for what the expert accomplishes and what would be acceptable.
