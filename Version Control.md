Version control implies keeping track of all the changes to your project. 
Having a github repository allows us to keep track of everything more easily. 
Each file on GitHub has a history, which allows us to easily study the changes made to it over time and by other members.
We can look over other people's code, make comments, and recommend changes. 
We created a main repository on github and store everything related to our project there. 
Where every member of the group can create files, commit changes, and review other people's work.
