Users usually want to know how to get in touch with the other participants involved in project.
Setting up a communication channel for your project where people can discuss things and new developers can easily reach you is quite beneficial. 
In Google Groups, we formed a group for our project. Because it contains the email addresses of its members, a Google Group is similar to a mailing list.
Google Groups is a Google Apps service that makes it simple to interact and cooperate with project team members.
In addition, we used google chats for posting and sending all realted disscuions and contributions needed to communicate to complete the project.
We can communicate with one another via the web or email by using Google Groups and Google Chats.
