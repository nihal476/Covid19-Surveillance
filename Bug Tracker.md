In the top menu of our github repository website, there is a "Issues" tab. 
Anyone in the project can access an issue, give it a title, add comments, report bugs, attach files and visual proofs, and label it. 
Members of the project can vote on concerns they want addressed. From commit messages, we may close issues.
