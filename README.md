# ITSE 476 - PHASE 1
# Covid19-Tracker
# Look Around First
# Start From What You Have
# Good Name
# Project Is Free and Open Source
# Features and Requirement List
# Development Status
* So far, the Initial functionality and basic design of the system have been completed.  
* However, the project is still in progress. 
* Developers and other people willing to collaborate with us will work together to complete the project. Until the project is completed, every implemented function will be made available in the repository.
# Download
* As our project is an open-source project, the repository will be free to use and download. 
* This project can be downloaded as a Zip file or cloned. 
* Put this project in the main directory. 
* Now open the project in your browser. It must work properly.
# Documentation
The documentation is written to let people know about our project and to inform them that we are new to open-source projects so it's not as comprehensive as it could be. We will provide instructions on how to use the Covid-19 Tracking System, which is used by both patients and doctors. It would identify those who were impacted. It is generally integrated with hospital administration software to give accessible visualizations illustrating various parts of the covid pandemic. Furthermore, we plan to avoid some of what we did in this documentation, even if it is incomplete, but it will provide a summary of what we did as well as a suggestion for what the expert accomplishes and what would be acceptable. 
# Developer Documentation
It cannot be written by someone who does not have programming skills; it is always developed by the programmers and developers. Its purpose is to educate other developers the way to deal with code, making it more social than technical. The developer documentation is included in the design document, and everything is sorted and structured using wikis.  
# Communication Channel
Users usually want to know how to get in touch with the other participants involved in project. Setting up a communication channel for your project where people can discuss things and new developers can easily reach you is quite beneficial. In Google Groups, we formed a group for our project. Because it contains the email addresses of its members, a Google Group is similar to a mailing list. Google Groups is a Google Apps service that makes it simple to interact and cooperate with project team members. We can communicate with one another via the web or email by using Google Groups.
# Version Control and Bug Tracker Access
## Version Control
Version control implies keeping track of all the changes to your project. Having a github repository allows us to keep track of everything more easily. Each file on GitHub has a history, which allows us to easily study the changes made to it over time and by other members. We can look over other people's code, make comments, and recommend changes.
We created a main repository on github and store everything related to our project there. Where every member of the group can create files, commit changes, and review other people's work.
## Bug/Issue Tracker 
In the top menu of our github repository website, there is a "Issues" tab. Anyone in the project can access an issue, give it a title, add comments, report bugs, attach files and visual proofs, and label it. Members of the project can vote on concerns they want addressed. From commit messages, we may close issues.
# Developer Guidelines
## General Guidelines
* Each should appreciate one another's viewpoints.
* Each must follow the code of behavior.
* All conversations should be held in public.
