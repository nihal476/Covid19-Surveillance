Here are some justifications for selecting github over alternative tools:

**1: Huge Developer Community:** GitHub is an excellent venue for open source projects because of its enormous developer community, which consists of over 56 million members.
Project owners may use this community to obtain feedback, problem reports, and feature requests, and developers can simply interact and contribute to projects.

**2: Integration with other tools:** GitHub has integrations with a large number of technologies, such as Slack and Trello for communication,
Travis CI and CircleCI for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and Codacy and Code Climate for code reviews. 
This enables developers to concentrate on developing code while streamlining their procedures.

**3: Ease of use:** Managing repositories, collaborating with others, and keeping track of bugs is made simple using GitHub's straightforward user interface. 
This is particularly crucial for open source projects as they frequently involve a large number of contributors who might not be conversant with the coding.

**4: Security and Reliability:** GitHub offers an exceptional degree of security and dependability.
All data is stored on servers located in several data centers throughout the globe, and HTTPS encryption is utilized to safeguard data while it is in transit. 
A group of committed security experts at GitHub also continuously scans the site for flaws and responds to any security events.
