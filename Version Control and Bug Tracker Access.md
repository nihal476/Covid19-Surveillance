# Version Control
Version control implies keeping track of all the changes to your project. 
Having a github repository allows us to keep track of everything more easily. 
Each file on GitHub has a history, which allows us to easily study the changes made to it over time and by other members. 
We can look over other people's code, make comments, and recommend changes.
We created a main repository on github and store everything related to our project there. 
Where every member of the group can create files, commit changes, and review other people's work.

# Bug or Issue Tracker
In the top menu of our github repository website, there is a "Issues" tab. 
Anyone in the project can access an issue, give it a title, add comments, report bugs, attach files and visual proofs, and label it. 
Members of the project can vote on concerns they want addressed. From commit messages, we may close issues.
